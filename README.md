# org-temp-file
Allows you to load, unload and write org-mode files from a central org file.

Warning: This project is not in a good state! It was my way of getting comfortable with Lisp while creating something cool for a tool I use often. It is not pretty, I do not know if it covers all edge cases, and so you should not rely on it! I will be backing up the files will use this with.
